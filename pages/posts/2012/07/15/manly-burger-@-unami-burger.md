<p>The manly burger at <a href="http://www.umami.com/umami-burger/">unami burger</a>: "beer-cheddar cheese, smoke salt-onion strings, bacon lardons." What else do I have to say?</p>

This might be the best burger I have ever eaten. It's that good.

We also got the beet salad (in the background), and some thin fries. The ketchup is made there and had an interesting flavor - very vinegary, maybe a little truffle oil?
