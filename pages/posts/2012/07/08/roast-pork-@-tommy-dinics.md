<p>We were just in Philadelphia, and stopped by the <a href="http://www.readingterminalmarket.org/">Reading Terminal Market</a> in search of the roast pork sandwich at <a href="http://tommydinics.com/">Tommy DiNic&#8217;s</a>. You may have seen it featured on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLYiR-dSbOs">Man Vs.

This is definitely one worth going out of your way for. The official way to get it is with sharp provolone and greens (broccoli rabe). They were out of the rabe, so we had to go with spinach, which is prepared the same way.</p> <p>The pork is incredibly juicy and delicious, then you have the nice bite of really good sharp provolone, and the garlicky bitterness of the greens. Delicious!</p>
