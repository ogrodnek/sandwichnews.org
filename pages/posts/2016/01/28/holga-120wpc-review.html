Thanks to some really amazing Seattle photographers, I've recently started shooting pinhole (photography without a lens!)

While you don't need to buy a camera to shoot pinhole, I think the [Holga 120 Wide Pinhole Camera](http://shop.lomography.com/en/holga-120-wide-pinhole-camera) has some nice features and is worth checking out.

I put together my first YouTube photography video with a quick review and intro for the camera.
