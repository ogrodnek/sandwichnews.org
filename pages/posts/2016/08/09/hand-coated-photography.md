This past weekend I was fortunate enough to take a workshop on some historical photo
processes at [pcnw](http://pcnw.org).

You can check out a [few of my scans on flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/logrodnek/albums/72157672241163415).

We covered both [Cyanotypes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyanotype)
 and [Van Dyke](http://sandykingphotography.com/resources/technical-writing/vandyke).

For both of these processes you apply the chemicals necessary for photosensitivity by hand
on paper.

I already like making photo prints by hand, and I think this lends even more to that process.
As a 'modern' photographer, I hate to admit that I like even the visible brush marks, but I
really do!

### Cyanotypes

The cyanotype process is especially interesting to me.  This was originally used
for reproducing drawings, and is how [blueprints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blueprint)
got their names (they were cyanotypes).

There are also some [incredible early images by Anna Atkins](https://digitalcollections.nypl.org/collections/photographs-of-british-algae-cyanotype-impressions#/)
published in 1843 using cyanotypes for images of seaweed and algae.

Yes, the chemicals are toxic, but seemingly less-so than almost any other photo process?

The 'developer' is just plain water...

You don't even really need a darkroom for this process, just no UV light.  And to develop,
you can use the sun (though it may be unpredictable).

Exposures take a long time (20 minutes), but, that's par for the course here.

Once you coat the images, it's pretty smooth sailing.

### Van Dyke

I honestly like the look of this process more than cyanotypes... But, it feels
a little heavier.  It requires a real fix, and thus an archival wash... It's more
like making a silver print.

### Future work

Even though I think my cyanotypes weren't especially successful, I feel like
it is a process I really enjoyed and would like to explore more.  The strong
blues don't work everywhere (although you can modify the tone a bit with other
bleaching/toning processes.)

Look for more here or on [my photo site](http://photos.ogrodnek.com/) on that subject :).
