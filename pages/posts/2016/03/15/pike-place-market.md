I just finished my final project for Black and White Photo II at [PCNW](http://pcnw.org).

I chose to focus on Pike Place Market here in Seattle.

I spent quite a bit of time there!  It was really great to get to know the space, people, and community so well.

The project was a ton of work, and I still feel like I could have used another month printing and editing.  While I feel like I will continue to work on and develop this project, I'm really happy at where it ended up and was proud to present these images to the rest of my class.

These were all shot on an older [Rolleicord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolleicord), Kodak TMax 400 film, and printed on Ilford Warmtone Glossy paper.
