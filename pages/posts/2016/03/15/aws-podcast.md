I recently started a new weekly aws/cloud/tech podcast with [Donnie Flood](https://twitter.com/floodfx) called [Engineers &amp; Coffee](http://engineers.coffee/).

It's been a lot of fun doing it and I'm really proud of what we've put out there.  I can't wait to see how it goes from here.

If you haven't yet, please [give it a listen](http://engineers.coffee/), and please send us some feedback!
