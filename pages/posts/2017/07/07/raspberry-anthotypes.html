I've been paging through the excellent
[Book of Alternative Photographic Processes](https://www.amazon.com/Book-Alternative-Photographic-Processes/dp/1285089316/?tag=engcoffee-20)
by [Christopher James](http://www.christopherjames-studio.com/).

Anthotypes caught my eye as something fun and easy to try.
It's an early process that uses flower or plant material
(the name is from the greek *anthos* meaning flower).

If you've ever noticed paint or fabric washed out from spending a long time in the sun,
that's basically the process!

There's a good step-by-step set of directions with photos on
the [Alternative Photography website](http://www.alternativephotography.com/anthotypes-making-print-using-plants/),
but basically:

-  mash up some flowers, plants, or fruits to produce a liquid.
    - optionally add alcohol to help with extraction, or vinegar (supposedly darkens?).
    - optionally strain out seeds, etc.
- coat some watercolor paper with the liquid and let it dry
- place something on the paper to block the sun where you want the image to appear
    - the color of the paper will be the darkest area of the print
    - anything uncovered will be lightened by the sun
        - unlike a 'typical' process, you want a *positive* image, not a *negative*
    - you can use cutouts, plants, etc. or print a black and white image on a transparency
    - a clip photo frame will help keep everything in place
- put it in the sun, and wait!

Exposure times seem to vary greatly depending on the plant material used.

For my prints, I used raspberry with some alcohol and put them out in the sun for 3 full days.
They probably could have used another day or two, but I got impatient.

As far as I know, there's no known way to fix the images (make them permanent).
Over time and with more UV exposure the images will eventually fade.


Anthotypes are a very old process (1842), but they never became that popular because of
the long exposure times and image impermanence - there's still a lot to explore!

It's a really fun, easy, safe and environmentally friendly photographic process.
I'd definitely recommend giving it a try!

I'm looking forward to trying it more with other plants.
Blackberries and spinach look like they produce good results with reasonable exposure times.

looks really fantastic, but seems to take a month or more (I'm not sure I have the patience required).
