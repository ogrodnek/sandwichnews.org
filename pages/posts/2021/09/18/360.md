I've started playing around with a 360 camera, the [instax 360 one x2](https://amzn.to/3ApnvZd).

  #panorama {
    width: 600px;
    height: 400px;
}    
</style>

<div id="panorama"></div>

<script>
var image = "/static/images/posts/2021/09/18/IMG_20210917_094313_00_043_PureShot.jpg"
pannellum.viewer('panorama', {
    "panorama": image,
    "autoLoad": true
});
</script>

It has two super wide lenses on either side of it, that get stitched together to produce a 360 image.

The coverage of the lenses actually overlaps enough to hide the camera (and selfie stick from view).

To produce an interactive 360 view like above, the photos are stiched together into a single image using an [Equirectangular projection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equirectangular_projection) (which you've probably seen used for maps of the earth).

The projections themselves are sometimes interesting as photos on their own. I want to continue to experiment with this. It's interesting to me that they appear so heavily manipulated, but in some sense are "straight out of the camera" (not exactly, but still..)

It feels like it could border on gimmicky if overdone, but I'm hoping to include a few of these in an upcoming photo zine I'm working on.
