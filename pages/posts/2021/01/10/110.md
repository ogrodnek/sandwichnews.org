I picked up a 110 film camera after seeing that [lomography produces film for 110](https://shop.lomography.com/en/films/110-film).

The _Fujica Pocket 200F_ was produced in 1977 and features a 29mm fixed focus lens at f11, and a mechanical shutter speed of 1/60. There are no exposure controls.

These negatives are _tiny_, about half the size of 35mm.

Overall, it was a fun camera to shoot! Since there are no exposure controls I just pointed and took the photo, hoping for the best, with mixed results :).

Some of the shots came out nice, and it was fun to get the contrasty, super grainy look. It made me want to go back to shooting more film - and that's aways a good thing!
