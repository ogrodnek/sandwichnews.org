In this talk on 
[Effective ML](http://vimeo.com/14313378), 
[Yaron Minsky](http://cufp.org/users/yminsky) talks about Reader Driven Development.  That is, writing your code with the reader in mind.  Making decisions that will make the code more easily read and understood by other developers down the line.

> The interest of the reader always pushes in the direction of clarity, simplicity, and the ability to change the code later. In most real projects, code is read and changed many more times than it is written. The readers interest are paramount in that regard.


 When writing code the interests of the reader and writer may be at odds, and when faced with a decision, always err in the direction of the reader.  The reader is always right.  Regardless of team size, it's helpful to program this way.  Even code you've written yourself may not be as clear 6 months or a year later otherwise.  Great perspective, and I think it fits in nicely with previous posts here on 
[programming style](2012-06-13-the-golden-rule-of-programming-style) and 
[code reviews](2012-03-13-on-code-reviews-and-developer-feedback) (tend to agree with your reviewers, they are the audience!).
