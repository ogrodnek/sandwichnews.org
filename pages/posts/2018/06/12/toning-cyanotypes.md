For PCNW's <a href="http://pcnw.org/support/longshot/">Longshot</a> this year, I worked on a series of cyanotype variations.

I really love cyanotype printing.  It's one of the [safer](http://www.analoguelab.com.au/cyanotype-safety/) photographic processes, you can coat the paper in light, you expose in the sun, and otherwise you just need water to rinse.

Sometimes, though, you get tired of blue!

[MP Photography](https://mpaulphotography.wordpress.com/2011/04/01/cyanotype-toning-the-basics/) has a great overview and examples of toning cyanotypes.  It's pretty easy (if time consuming).

The weather was a little weird when I made these: switching between overcast, rainy, sunny, cloudy, so I had a difficult time with exposure.  Luckily, toning also seems to be a good way to rescue prints with exposure issues.

As part of the process, you bleach the print, so, it's ok if the print is overexposed a bit.  There's also typically some staining, so it can help a bit with midtones and highlights if underexposed.

The above tea print is my favorite of the bunch.  It was a bit underexposed, so I didn't bleach it, but just soaked it in tea for 3 hours.  I think the tea tone works well for the photo, and I like the blue border that remains.

I do really like the cooler, closer to black look you get from coffee toning.  This was a bit overexposed. I bleached for a bit, then 3 hours in coffee.  I'm tempted to try for longer next time.

For comparison, above is a normal cyanotype print with no toning.

Part of the fun of these analog processes is the one of a kind results and ocassional surprises.  It's also been a fun reminder to not worry as much about mistakes or imperfections and just embrace them.

The original image I used to make these prints was shot on color film with an old folding camera that had light leaks (see below)!

I can see the artifacts of the leaks in the final prints, but it's a lot less noticable and doesn't bother me at all.
