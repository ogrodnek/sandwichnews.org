I recently bought a [cheap Fuji instax camera](https://amzn.to/2znoG0p) for an upcoming road trip.  I had been wanting to try out the instax film and I thought my 6 year old daughter would have fun documenting the trip with me.

The ergonomics of this specific camera are terrible, but having the prints instantly make up for it.

Most of the fuji instant cameras are pretty basic with not a lot of control and cheap lenses, but it's exciting to start to see some 3rd party cameras coming out, like the [Mint InstantKon](https://mint-camera.com/about-instantkon-rf70/8/6751/7ba062720037b5113a1ffbc61e11fc79).

Overall, it's a lot of fun to use and cheap enough to just go for it.

My daughter shot most of the color film right away, but wanted nothing to do with the black and white.

I took the camera out on a photowalk with a friend to [Centennial Park](https://www.portseattle.org/places/centennial-park) here in Seattle and I was pretty happy with the results.  The black and white is a little high contrast, but it has a good look.
