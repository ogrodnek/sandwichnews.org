I had become interested in large format photography after a workshop with [Daniel Carrillo](http://www.daniel-carrillo.com/) on Wet Plate.

My friend, [Hank](https://www.espressobuzz.net/), had given me a large format monorail camera, and I had taken it out a few times.  It was exciting and fun, but also frustrating and my results had been mixed.

When I saw [Daniel Gregory](https://www.danieljgregory.com/) was teaching a Large Format Film and Lighting class at [PCNW](http://pcnw.org) last winter, I was on board.

Here are some 11x14 darkroom prints from a recent junkyard trip (a mix of Ilford Matte and Ilford Warmtone fiber papers).

I've really been enjoying the process.  While there are still frustrations, after repeated practice things are a lot smoother.  I really love the simplicity and thoughtful intention that seems to come with shooting large format.
