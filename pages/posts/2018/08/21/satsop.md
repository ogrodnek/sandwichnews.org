The [Satsop Nuclear Power Plant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WNP-3_and_WNP-5) was part of a larger effort to provide power to the Pacific Northwest.  Construction started in the late 1970s and was ultimately abandoned before completion.

These days it's a [business park](https://www.satsop.com/), with normal office space, big warehouses, as well as some interesting use of the tunnels and buildings for fire/military training, movies, etc.

I went as part of a photo outing with [pcnw](http://pcnw.org) a few months ago.  It sounds like it's pretty easy to schedule a group tour of the buildings (with some cost involved) if you are in the area and want to check it out (it's a few hours south of Seattle).

Since we were moving to New York, I thought this would be my last big photo trip in Seattle, so I brought way too many cameras, including my huge 4x5, which I regret lugging around (although I still haven't developed the film, so who knows!).

I was pretty happy with how my instant photos came out!  I still have a ton of fun with the instax, and it's so nice to have the prints right away to share.
