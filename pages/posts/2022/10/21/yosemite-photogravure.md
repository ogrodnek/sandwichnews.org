I had an incredible time earlier this month learning how to make
[Photogravure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photogravure) prints at the [Ansel Adams Gallery](https://www.anseladams.com) in Yosemite.

We had a fantastic instructor, [Clay Harmon](https://www.clayharmon.com/images), who wrote [the book on Polymer Photogravure](https://www.amazon.com/Polymer-Photogravure-Step-Step-Highlighting/dp/0815366043).

It really was an amazing experience waking up every morning in Yosemite, walking to class (occassionally seeing bears on the way!) and spending the day making prints in Ansel Adams' darkroom - I felt like a real artist!

We even got the opportunity to spend some time exploring a few locations in the park to take photos, guided by Michael from the gallery who was an amazing guide and teacher.

I feel like I'm hooked on the process.

Below are some of my prints from the workshop.

I got to make a _ton_ of prints. None of them are perfect, but I am ready for more practice!

It's really such a fun process that I can't wait to try again.
