The interesting part is that it’s typically served “with vegetables,” which means grilled onions and peppers, jalapeños, and tomato. It’s very tasty and makes me wonder why I don’t see more jalapeños at breakfast.</p> <p>I’ve been making my own version of this sandwich the last couple weekends and I’ve been really happy with it.</p> <p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/logrodnek/6529350329/"><img src="/static/images/posts/2011/12/18/downtown-la-breakfast/6529350329_06d141fe74.jpg"/></a></p> <p>The peppers and onions take awhile to cook, but it’s worth it.</p> <p>My one regret is that I didn’t get a chance to try out the Bulgogi Cheesesteak at the Sandwich Shop… Next trip.</p>
